# IO_files_with_Cpp
File input and output practice in C++

This program was created for a final project in my C++ course. The program is meant to test knowledge of file input and output in C++, which I found to be rather confusing. The program is nestled under one file, main.cpp, which was done for simplification purposes as I did not have time to stretch the program accross different files. The purpose of this file is to read in a string of words from the user. Any words that start with the letter A are capitalized and stored in a .txt file, input.txt. Then, when the user wants to read out of the file, the words that begin with A are read out in capital form. The program contains a user interface that allows the user to choose whether to read in or out of the file.
